###### **Security Awareness Training**

Security awareness training is a critical component of any organization's security program. It is designed to educate employees about security risks and how to protect themselves and the organization from attack.

There are a number of different security awareness training programs available. Some of the most common programs include:

* **Online training:** Online training is a convenient and cost-effective way to deliver security awareness training. It can be accessed by employees from any location and at any time.
* **In-person training:** In-person training is a more interactive and engaging way to deliver security awareness training. It can be used to cover more complex topics and to answer employee questions.
* **Blended training:** Blended training combines online and in-person training. This can be a more effective way to deliver security awareness training, as it allows employees to learn at their own pace and to get the most out of both types of training.

The best security awareness training program for an organization will vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization, the budget, and the needs of the employees.

Here are some of the benefits of security awareness training:

Sure, here is a long blog post on Application Security Testing (AST) in a creative informal style, using markdown syntax:

# Application Security Testing: Protecting Your Apps

Application security testing (AST) is the process of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in software applications. AST can be performed at any stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from design and development to testing and deployment.

There are a number of different AST techniques, including:

* **Static application security testing (SAST):** SAST tools analyze the source code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic application security testing (DAST):** DAST tools interact with an application in its running state to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Interactive application security testing (IAST):** IAST tools combine the static and dynamic analysis techniques of SAST and DAST to provide a more comprehensive view of an application's security posture.

AST is an important part of any comprehensive security program. By identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC, AST can help to prevent costly data breaches and other security incidents.

## The Benefits of AST

There are a number of benefits to performing AST on your applications, including:

* **Reduced risk of data breaches:** AST can help to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to steal data.
* **Increased compliance:** AST can help you to meet security compliance requirements, such as those mandated by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
* **Improved customer confidence:** By demonstrating that you are taking steps to protect your applications from attack, you can improve customer confidence in your organization.

## The Challenges of AST

There are a number of challenges associated with AST, including:

* **Cost:** AST tools can be expensive to purchase and maintain.
* **Complexity:** AST can be a complex and time-consuming process.
* **False positives:** AST tools can sometimes generate false positives, which can lead to wasted time and resources.

## How to Get Started with AST

If you are new to AST, there are a number of things you can do to get started, including:

* **Assess your security needs:** Before you start testing, it is important to assess your security needs and determine which types of vulnerabilities are most likely to affect your applications.
* **Choose the right tools:** There are a number of different AST tools available, so it is important to choose the tools that are right for your needs.
* **Develop a testing plan:** Once you have chosen your tools, you need to develop a testing plan that outlines the steps you will take to test your applications.
* **Test regularly:** AST should be an ongoing process. You should test your applications regularly to identify and mitigate new vulnerabilities as they emerge.

## Conclusion

AST is an important part of any comprehensive security program. By identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC, AST can help to prevent costly data breaches and other security incidents. If you are new to AST, there are a number of things you can do to get started, including assessing your security needs, choosing the right tools, developing a testing plan, and testing regularly.

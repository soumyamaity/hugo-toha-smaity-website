Sure, here is a long blog post on Application security best practices in a creative informal style, using markdown syntax:

## Application Security Best Practices

Application security is a critical aspect of any organization's overall security posture. By following best practices, organizations can help to protect their applications from attack and data breaches.

Here are some application security best practices:

* **Use a secure development lifecycle (SDLC).** The SDLC is the process of developing, testing, and deploying applications. A secure SDLC includes security activities throughout the entire process, from requirements gathering to maintenance.
* **Implement secure coding practices.** Secure coding practices are techniques that developers can use to write code that is resistant to attack. Some common secure coding practices include input validation, output encoding, and error handling.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF).** A WAF is a security device that can help to protect applications from common attack vectors, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
* **Educate employees about security risks.** Employees are often the weakest link in the security chain. By educating employees about security risks, organizations can help to prevent them from making mistakes that could lead to data breaches.
* **Keep software up to date.** Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect applications from known vulnerabilities. Organizations should keep all software up to date, including web applications, operating systems, and browsers.
* **Monitor applications for suspicious activity.** Organizations should monitor applications for suspicious activity, such as unusual traffic patterns or failed login attempts. This can help to identify attacks early and take steps to mitigate them.
* **Have a plan in place to respond to security incidents.** Security incidents are inevitable. By having a plan in place to respond to incidents, organizations can minimize the damage caused by an attack.

By following these best practices, organizations can help to protect their applications from attack and data breaches.

## Additional tips

In addition to the best practices listed above, here are some additional tips for securing applications:

* **Use a security framework.** Security frameworks provide a set of best practices and guidelines that can be used to secure applications. Some popular security frameworks include OWASP Top Ten, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and SANS Critical Security Controls.
* **Get input from security experts.** Security experts can help organizations to identify and mitigate security risks.
* **Test applications for security vulnerabilities.** It is important to test applications for security vulnerabilities before deploying them. This can help to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
* **Use a secure hosting environment.** The hosting environment can play a role in the security of an application. Organizations should choose a hosting environment that has a strong security posture.
* **Monitor applications for security threats.** It is important to monitor applications for security threats after they have been deployed. This can help to identify and respond to attacks quickly.

By following these tips, organizations can help to secure their applications and protect themselves from attack.

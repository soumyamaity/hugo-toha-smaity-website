## Application Security Testing Tools

Application security testing (AST) tools are used to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in applications. There are a number of different AST tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Some of the most popular AST tools include:

* **OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP):** ZAP is a free and open-source tool that can be used to scan web applications for security vulnerabilities.
* **Burp Suite:** Burp Suite is a commercial tool that offers a more comprehensive set of features than ZAP.
* **Nessus:** Nessus is another commercial tool that is known for its large vulnerability database.
* **QualysGuard:** QualysGuard is a cloud-based tool that offers a wide range of security scanning services, including AST.

When choosing an AST tool, it is important to consider the following factors:

* **The type of applications you need to test:** Some tools are better suited for web applications, while others are better suited for mobile applications or APIs.
* **The features you need:** Some tools offer a more comprehensive set of features than others.
* **Your budget:** AST tools can range in price from free to thousands of dollars.

Once you have chosen an AST tool, you need to configure it to scan your applications for the specific vulnerabilities you are concerned about. You can also use the tool to generate reports that can be used to track your progress and identify areas where your applications are most vulnerable.

AST tools are an essential part of any application security program. By using them, you can identify and assess security vulnerabilities in your applications before they can be exploited by attackers.

Here are some additional tips for using AST tools:

* **Use multiple tools:** No single AST tool can find all security vulnerabilities. By using multiple tools, you can increase your chances of finding all of the vulnerabilities in your applications.
* **Scan frequently:** Applications are constantly being updated, which means that new vulnerabilities are being introduced all the time. It is important to scan your applications frequently to ensure that you are up-to-date on the latest vulnerabilities.
* **Involve developers:** Developers are the ones who create applications, so they are the ones who know the most about them. By involving developers in the AST process, you can get their input on how to improve the security of your applications.

By following these tips, you can use AST tools to improve the security of your applications.

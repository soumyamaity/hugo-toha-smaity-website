###### **Application security for beginners**

Application security is the practice of protecting software applications from attack. It is an important part of overall information security, as applications are often the targets of malicious actors.

There are a number of different types of application security threats, including:

* **Injection attacks:** Injection attacks are a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into an application. This malicious code can then be executed by the application, which can lead to data loss, system disruption, or other problems.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:** XSS attacks are a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. This malicious code can then be executed by the victim's browser, which can lead to data theft, identity theft, or other problems.
* **SQL injection attacks:** SQL injection attacks are a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a database application. This malicious code can then be executed by the database, which can lead to data loss or unauthorized access to the database.
* **Directory traversal attacks:** Directory traversal attacks are a type of attack where an attacker can access files and directories that they should not be able to access. This can lead to data loss or unauthorized access to the application.
* **Broken authentication and session management:** Broken authentication and session management are vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to an application. This can be done by stealing passwords, session tokens, or other authentication credentials.

There are a number of things that can be done to improve application security, including:

* **Using secure coding practices:** Secure coding practices are a set of guidelines that can be used to write secure code. These guidelines can help to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into applications.
* **Testing for vulnerabilities:** Applications should be tested for vulnerabilities before they are deployed. This testing can help to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.
* **Implementing security controls:** Security controls can be implemented to protect applications from attack. These controls can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control lists.
* **Educating employees:** Employees should be educated about security risks and how to protect themselves from attack. This education can help to prevent employees from accidentally introducing vulnerabilities into applications or from falling victim to social engineering attacks.

By taking these steps, organizations can improve application security and protect their applications from attack.

Here are some additional tips for improving application security:

* **Use strong passwords:** Strong passwords should be used for all accounts. Strong passwords should be at least 12 characters long and should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Be careful what you click on:** Phishing emails often contain links to malicious websites. Do not click on links in emails unless you are sure that they are legitimate.
* **Use a web browser extension:** There are a number of web browser extensions that can help to block malicious traffic.
* **Be aware of the latest threats:** It is important to stay up-to-date on the latest threats. There are a number of resources available that can help you to stay informed.

By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from application security threats.

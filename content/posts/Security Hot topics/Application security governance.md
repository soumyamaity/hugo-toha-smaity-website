* **Improved compliance:** Organizations that implement application security governance can help to comply with security regulations, such as PCI DSS and HIPAA.
* **Increased customer trust:** Customers are more likely to trust organizations that take security seriously. Implementing application security governance can help to build customer trust and loyalty.

There are a number of challenges to implementing application security governance, including:

* **Lack of resources:** Organizations may not have the resources to implement a comprehensive application security governance program.
* **Lack of expertise:** Organizations may not have the expertise to implement and manage an application security governance program.
* **Lack of commitment:** Senior leadership may not be committed to application security governance.

Despite the challenges, application security governance is an essential part of any organization's overall security program. By implementing application security governance, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches, improve compliance, and increase customer trust.
